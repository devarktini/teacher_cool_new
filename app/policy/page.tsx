        <p className="mb-4">
          We may collect information from you both directly and automatically when you use our Services. Some of this
          information may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” some of which may be considered
          “sensitive,” under various countries applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific,
          identified individual to be personal information (such as your name and email address), and we treat additional
          information, including IP addresses and online identifiers, as personal information where required by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Note that we may pseudonymize, de-identify, or anonymize personal information so that it is non-personal, such
          as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a “hash.” We maintain
          and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as
          to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat pseudonymized,
          de-identified, or anonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. We collect information in the following ways:</h3>

          (such as your profile picture and birthday); payment and financial information; educational information (such as
          your school and year of graduation); demographic information (such as your gender, race, eligibility to work in the
          country, and work history); information about your interests and preferences (such as your career goals, academic
          interests, and clubs or sports you participate in). Some features may allow you to communicate and collaborate with
          each other, including through video or text chat, or otherwise to view, create, reproduce, submit, display, perform,
          and/or share content, which includes videos, audio, images, graphics, written posts, comments, survey responses, and
          other forms of multimedia (collectively, “User Content”).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">

        </p>

        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">b. Information We Collect Automatically From Your Use of our Services:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you use our Services, we, our third-party service providers, and our business partners may automatically collect
          certain information (“Usage Information”). One of the ways we collect Usage Information is when you visit portions
          of our Services, our servers automatically generate logs to help us determine how people navigate through our Services,
          the content you access, and other interactions you may have with our Services. We use this insight to create a better
          and more secure experience for our users. Usage Information does not generally identify you, but if we associate it
          with you as a specific person, we treat it as personal information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This Usage Information may include your IP address and unique device identifiers (“Device IDs”) for your computer,
          mobile phone, or other device used to access our Services. A Device ID is a number that is automatically assigned
          to your device, and our servers identify your device by its Device ID. We will also collect other information
          relating to your device, including the Internet service provider you are using, the type of computer operating system
          you are using, the type of browser you use, and the approximate location of your device, which may be collected or
          inferred through other information we collect, such as IP address.
        </p>

        <h2>We use the following types of tracking technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) to automatically collect information when you interact with us online:</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Cookies and Local Storage are small text files stored locally on your device that help store user preferences. These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for a device that allows us to recognize the device whenever it is used to visit our Services. These technologies may be used for many purposes by us, our service providers,  such as automatically collecting Usage Information, enabling features, serving advertisements to you online, and remembering your preferences. We may use cookies and other technologies to help keep your use of the Services more secure, to study traffic patterns on the Services, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, to maintain the integrity of the Services, to measure crash analytics and other maintenance-related information, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Services, and to personalize your experience through the Services, such as to recognize you when you return to the Services. The information we store includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser, or depending on your location, via settings we make available on our Services. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at www.allaboutcookies.org. You can also find our cookie notice here.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with our Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with our Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from our Services.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          In addition, we may record your interactions with the Service’s user interfaces, including what pages you visit on our Services and how long you visit those pages, the links you click, and your path through our Services. We capture this for website analytics purposes, solely for our internal business purposes, to improve the Services and to address functionality issues.
        </p>


        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">c. Chat Boxes:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you participate in our chat with TeacherCool Support sessions, we can record and use your communications and the information you provide in order to assist you during the chat session and to improve the Services.
        </p>
        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">d. Video Call Recording:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you use our LMS service, we may record video calls between instructors and students, for example one-to-one meetings between instructors and students and class instruction sessions for quality assurance and security purposes. If we record such a call, notice will be provided to you within the video call tool.
        </p>
        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">e. Information from Third Parties:</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We may receive information about you from third parties, such as data providers who enhance the information we have about you, publicly available information, third parties with whom we partner to offer our services to their subscribers, loan partners, or third parties that you integrate into the Services, such as social media platforms.
        </p>
        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-1">f. Social Media and Other Third-Party Platforms. :</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We may enable you to interact with social media and other third-party platforms, including Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and LinkedIn, including the use of their login service. When you interact with third party platforms through the Services, we will receive information about you. We may also receive information about you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections. The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices about what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. We or the third party may allow you to disable or remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>
          If you choose to post information to a third-party platform, that information may be public, and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of the Services. You may also choose to participate in a way that connects that third-party service with the Services, such as posting to one of our pages on a social media site. Doing so may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information, and the third party may allow us to re-post content that is related to us on our own services.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          In addition, these third parties may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of the Services, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which areas of our Services you visit. Certain third-party platforms may be able to collect information on your visits to our Services, regardless of whether you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether you are logged into (or have) an account. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties that control platforms you post to or that connect to the Services and set your privacy preferences directly with them.

              Indian residents have the right to request from companies conducting business in certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time TeacherCool offers that choice, we will not share your personal information with that third party for its direct marketing purposes.
